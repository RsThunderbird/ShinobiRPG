ABOUT US - SHINOBI RPG

Welcome to Shinobi RPG - A Discord Based Naruto RPG game.

Hello! I'm gonna head straight to the point; we're the best combat game you can find on discord where your strat is all that matters. 
The game revolves around missions which are super interactive and like i mentioned before, your strategy is all that matters. You can be a level
1 newbie and still defeat a level 100 pro if you play your moves right. 
There's over 120 commands in the game.

What Makes Us Different?

DEPTH 
The combat system has infinite depth. You can create infinite builds and combos that work well with eachother or you can be a cheeser and use
annoying jutsus to win. 

This isnt a dead game. We do season based events like Winter, or follow our own lore and make something like an akatsuki event. 

We actively engage with our players, no, i mean that. Because im just another discordian who loves to hangout. 

We believe in fair play. The Game dosent force you to buy premium currencies. There's a ton of premium stuff that you can buy with real money 
OR you can use our Free player program, which is essentially watching ads in return for ingame rewards.

We're here to create the best Fighting based RPG on the platform. 
We want to build more than just a game. We're creating a community where people can hangout and have fun. Every player who joins becomes part of our story.
