## 🎯 Pro Tips

1. **Combo Potential**: Jutsus that stun (like Summon Ninken, Shadow Strangle) are perfect for setting up high-damage attacks.

2. **Chakra Management**: Don't spam expensive jutsus. Use Analysis or other chakra-gain techniques to maintain your reserves.

3. **Status Effects Stack**: Bleeding, burning, and poison can stack up quickly. Use multiple status-applying jutsus for devastating damage over time.

4. **Defense Breakers**: Jutsus like Guillotine Drop and Crystal Palace that reduce or ignore defense are crucial against tanky opponents.

5. **Healing Timing**: Save healing jutsus like Mystic Palm Enhanced for when you're below 50% health for maximum efficiency.

6. **Event Exclusives**: Keep an eye out for limited-time events - they often have the most powerful jutsus.
