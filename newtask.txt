Zoro 3d model dosent load, it actually rendered your fallback so i added new zoro.glb to try to fix it. THE SOUNDS dialogues DO NOT play during the 
convo with zoro and no notificaiton of quest start, no quest, no meats lying around nothing. Do it in a systematic way. 

for the cave part, during the bats game the text box dosent disappear the one that says "you walk into left" something realted.
make that box go away as soon as u enter the cave or u cant finish the bats minigame.
Make the dialogues and the 3d model work.
