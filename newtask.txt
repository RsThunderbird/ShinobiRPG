Alright lets get the story down (rough)
basically after the zoro meat quest, zoro agrees to help user. 
Now i need your suggestion on what to do next because clearly im new to 3.js world building and idk what to do next. Make me a list of suggestions,
several ones.

So the first thing i wanna point out is zoro. zoro.glb is imported as is and he's in his T-form. We need to make it so that zoro is standing
normally not in his t form. And then the big issue of erratic scale. The size of zoro, the meat everything is erratic. Zoro must be 2 meters tall
meat should be big enough so we can see them on the ground properly and big. Then if the zoro quest is complete, zoro does an animation 
in his t form. maybe a little sign or a dance?





LATER: 


Until then though we need to do the polishing: (well do this later after the above is done)
The cave part:
The game now starts before the cave scene with a "Start" button on a black screen. Ofcourse now the main focus of this polish is to make the game
optimized for mobile.
So the rotate your screen feature will appear here itself on the start screen. And as soon as start is clicked, force fullscreen mode.
Now the changes:
as soon as start is clicked the audio is played:
The cave.mp3 must start playing as soon as the start button is pressed at 45% volume only.
Then the dialogue plays: narrator1.mp3
Then a cinematic plays and this is where it gets super interesting. We need to make a cinematic where the player in first person mode is seen 
cutting a log. the only user prompt needed is clicks, and the log gets cut after 3 clicks. 
The dialogue while this happens: narrator2.mp3
then after this...PAUSE
