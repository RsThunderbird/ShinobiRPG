hmm, that was good butt not good enough. first of all thats not a watch tower xd, thats like a wooden cone with nothing on it. 
so i went to sketch fab and found us one! wt.glb use that instead. For the npc, just make the npc stand infront of the watchtower outside so we dont have
to do all the interiors. ALso the compass isnt accurate at all! it took me the wrong direction! Remove the "pathways" and the old watchtower completely. 
ANd please make the compass accurate, it also appears on the storyline phase during the caves, can we make it so that it only appears when we enter the forest?
if its too complicated or game breaking or risky, leave it alone.

Yeah just add the watchtower and the npc. Then add these: 
**Post-Processing:** We can add "Bloom" (glow), Depth of Field (blurring far objects), and Color Grading to make the game look movie-quality.
just make sure it dosent lag the game for mobile users.

**Lighting:** We can add "Directional Light" (for the sun) and "Point Light" (for the torches) to make the game look more realistic.
