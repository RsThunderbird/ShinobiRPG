PERFECT 10/10
Now we'll work on the same thing; the forest adding details and features to it. We need to play the bgmusicstatic.mp3 to the background of the 
forest music. Then we need to add a Directional Guide, a compass on the middle right of the screen. Basically points towards an 
Outpost. Yes, we need to make like a watch tower with an npc inside. This npc is called Guardian and is a simple npc. The outpost 
should also be simple. the user can indeed interact with this npc, for now, he says hello.
Since we now have an outpost, we need to add pathways accross the terrain, flowers on the side, again super low poly for formality and so that
the world dosent feel empty. 

then i need you to make me a "our limitations and how much we can do with this" in a user.txt file. Basically i need more information on how much
more we can do with 3.js and its limitations and capabilities. Also include the absolute pinnacle of what we can do with this.
