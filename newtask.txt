OKAYYYY
IM really happy with the progress but its now time to continue working, we got down a huge chunk of the thing but we still need to continue working on the thing.
the forest, i mean. We'll make a full on game just Because we can. I love how the forest turned out, BUT we need to make it better. 
It's too dark, add a sun, clouds, light allat. 
the terrain is too flat, make a "natural" terrain like random bumps and allat. 
Further controls: add space to jump and shift to run. For mobile, the joystick was as if it was pulling me towards bottom right, fix it and add equal support.

We'll go step by step, so finish this first then we'll add map, a quest tracker, an outpost and the quest itself, do the above first though.
