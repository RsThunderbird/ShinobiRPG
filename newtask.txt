i provided the 3d model for the guardian npc, we need to rename the guardian guy to 'zoro' the 3d model name is zoro.glb
Now the story and the quests begin.
Zoro is lost. He talks to user.
Dialogue:
dialogue 1: zoro voice: Huh? Who are you? Do you know what this place is? dialogue1.mp3 (im including text as well because we'll be using captions)
user: I was kidnapped by someone and trapped in that cave nearby! This must be the Konoha Forest. (no mp3 for user dialogue)
dialogue 2: Konoha Forest? Where's Luffy? Get me out of here and I will help you with the kidnapper! dialogue2.mp3
user: Luffy? I don't know who your talking about. Come, let's go to the village and ask for help. 
dialogue3: Okay. But first find me some food! dialogue3.mp3
user: alright...
food quest begins, show notification on screen and then ask the user to bring 5 pieces of meat for zoro. meat.glb for meat scatter around 15
meats near the area of watchtower. Click to take. 

Note: zoro npc 3d model is a T pose 3d model meaning we probably can apply whatever animations we want but for now, let it be normal standing 
position. if user picks up 5 pieces of meat just display Complete on screen for now.

for the conversation between user and zoro just make sure the text is displayed on screen and the audio is played. in a clean format.
